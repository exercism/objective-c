# RNA Transcription

Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).

Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.

The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and thymine (**T**).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**),
guanine (**G**) and uracil (**U**).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing
each nucleotide with its complement:

* `G` -> `C`
* `C` -> `G`
* `T` -> `A`
* `A` -> `U`

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read the [Installing](https://exercism.io/tracks/objective-c/installation) and
[Running the Tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/objective-c/tests) pages for Objective-C on exercism.io.
This covers the basic information on setting up the development
environment expected by the exercises.

### Submitting Exercises

When submitting an exercise, make sure your solution file is in the same directory as the test code.

The submit command will look something like:

```shell
exercism submit <path-to-exercism-workspace>/objective-c/rna-transcription/RnaTranscription.m
```

You can find the Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line beginning
with `Workspace:`.
