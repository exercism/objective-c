# Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:

Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2. If n is
odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely.
The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will
always reach 1 eventually.

Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.

## Examples

Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:

0. 12
1. 6
2. 3
3. 10
4. 5
5. 16
6. 8
7. 4
8. 2
9. 1

Resulting in 9 steps. So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have read the [Installing](https://exercism.io/tracks/objective-c/installation) and
[Running the Tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/objective-c/tests) pages for Objective-C on exercism.io.
This covers the basic information on setting up the development
environment expected by the exercises.

### Submitting Exercises

When submitting an exercise, make sure your solution file is in the same directory as the test code.

The submit command will look something like:

```shell
exercism submit <path-to-exercism-workspace>/objective-c/collatz-conjecture/CollatzConjecture.m
```

You can find the Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line beginning
with `Workspace:`.
