# Scrabble Score

Given a word, compute the scrabble score for that word.

## Letter Values

You'll need these:

```plain
Letter                           Value
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1
D, G                               2
B, C, M, P                         3
F, H, V, W, Y                      4
K                                  5
J, X                               8
Q, Z                               10
```

## Examples
"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

- 3 points for C
- 1 point for A, twice
- 3 points for B, twice
- 2 points for G
- 1 point for E

And to total:

- `3 + 2*1 + 2*3 + 2 + 1`
- = `3 + 2 + 6 + 3`
- = `5 + 9`
- = 14

## Extensions
- You can play a double or a triple letter.
- You can play a double or a triple word.

## Setup

There are two different methods of getting set up to run the tests with Objective-C:

- Create an Xcode project with a test target which will run the tests.
- Use the ruby gem `objc` as a test runner utility.

Both are described in more detail here: http://exercism.io/languages/objective-c


### Submitting Exercises

When submitting an exercise, make sure your solution file is in the same directory as the test code.

For example, if you're submitting `Bob.m` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/objective-c/bob/Bob.m`.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
