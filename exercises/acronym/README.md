# Acronym

Convert a phrase to its acronym.

Techies love their TLA (Three Letter Acronyms)!

Help generate some jargon by writing a program that converts a long name
like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).

## Setup

There are two different methods of getting set up to run the tests with Objective-C:

- Create an Xcode project with a test target which will run the tests.
- Use the ruby gem `objc` as a test runner utility.

Both are described in more detail here: http://exercism.io/languages/objective-c


### Submitting Exercises

When submitting an exercise, make sure your solution file is in the same directory as the test code.

For example, if you're submitting `Bob.m` for the Bob exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/objective-c/bob/Bob.m`.
