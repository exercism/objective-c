# Reverse String

Reverse a string.

For example: input: "cool" output: "looc"

## Setup

There are two different methods of getting set up to run the tests with Objective-C:

- Create an Xcode project with a test target which will run the tests.
- Use the ruby gem `objc` as a test runner utility.

Both are described in more detail here: http://exercism.io/languages/objective-c

### Submitting Exercises

When submitting an exercise, make sure your solution file is in the same directory as the test code.

The submit command will look something like:

```shell
exercism submit <path-to-exercism-workspace>/objective-c/robot-name/RobotName.m
```

You can find the Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line beginning
with Workspace.
