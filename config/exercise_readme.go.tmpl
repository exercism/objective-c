## Getting Started

Make sure you have read the [Installing](https://exercism.io/tracks/objective-c/installation) and
[Running the Tests](https://exercism.io/tracks/objective-c/tests) pages for Objective-C on exercism.io.
This covers the basic information on setting up the development
environment expected by the exercises.

### Submitting Exercises

When submitting an exercise, make sure your solution file is in the same directory as the test code.

The submit command will look something like:

```shell
exercism submit <path-to-exercism-workspace>/objective-c/{{ .Spec.Slug }}/{{ .Spec.MixedCaseName }}.m
```

You can find the Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line beginning
with `Workspace:`.
